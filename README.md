Attempt at real-time path tracing on the CPU. Yet another one of those problems
that could use a 1000x faster CPU. The path tracer is simple; no bidirectional
path tracing nor metropolis light transport. Initially inspired by smallpt. It
traces against a Build engine-like 2.5D structure (so guess where "ks" came
from).
